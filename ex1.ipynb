       "'## Explanation of Code \\n\\nThe given code is utilizing a feature of Python called \"generator expressions\" or \"dictionary comprehension\" to create generator that aggregates values. However, in this case, one key piece stands out - `yield from`.\\n\\nHere\\'s what the code does:\\n\\n- It starts with the `{...}` syntax which indicates a dictionary comprehension.\\n- The expression inside is `(book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\"))`.\\n  - This is a generator expression that creates an iterator over a set of values. \\n  - The `for` keyword followed by the variable name and the list/books/iterable in this case \"books\" tells Python to create an iterator.\\n  - Inside the loop, it only goes through the books where the key (\"author\") exists by using the `.get()` method which can be used with either keys or default values if that isn\\'t found. It returns `book.get(\"author\")`\\n- This generator expression is contained within the `{}` dictionary comprehension.\\n\\nNow we come to the actual Python construct:\\n```python\\nyield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\\n```\\n\\nHere\\'s what this does:\\n\\n\\n- `yield from` is an advanced construct introduced in Python 3.3 that allows code to delegate iteration to another iterable (typically a generator or iter). \\n\\n- In these cases, we pass the iterator from the `{...}` dictionary comprehension to yield from the values.\\n- Using `yield form` makes much of that expression easier with a better readability since it now gives more clues around what you\\'re using here and what \"books\". It is especially helpful in more complex cases where you have multiple iterables that should be consumed in order.\\n\\n## Example usage\\n\\nGiven an example dictionary (using the books):\\n```python\\nbooks = [\\n    {\"title\": ..., \"author\": \"...\"},\\n    {\"title\": ..., \"author\"...},\\n]\\n\\n```\\nWe simply get all authors:\\n\\n```python\\ndef extract_authors(books):\\n    return yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\\n\\nauthors = list(extract_authors(books))\\nprint(authors)\\n```\\n\\nUsing that generator expression without `yield from`, we see it looks a bit longer with extra brackets around the inner dictionary comprehension.'"
